# cerebrovascular_segmentation
We proposed a GAN-based deep-based method that maps the TOF-MRA data to 3D cerebral vessels. To improve the capability of feature expression, the proposed network integrates squeeze-and- excite blocks into a Vnet structure to extract and accumulate features at different scales.
